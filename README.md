>Tweak What You Get Editor (v.0.1)


###What is Twyg?

Twig is a .js strictly development-side command tool for dynamically tweaking css properties of selected elements of a page.

###Why?

With the coming of age WYWSIWYGS (Such as Google Web Designer, Macaw and Dreamweaver) - I was looking to ask the question: What kind of a WYSIWYG would i ***actually*** want to use in my workflow?

From my insight - i came with the conclusion that what was mainly inticing about WYSIWYGS was that they provided a way to dynamically change element styling - an "ide" for the mouse.

So what if i can edit my Css with my mouse but without sacrificing my existing workflow?

At least my answer was - an unbiased based js script - or Twyg.
