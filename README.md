>Tweak What You Get Editor


###What is Twyg?

Twig is a .js strictly development-side command tool for dynamically tweaking css properties of selected elements of a page.

###Why?

With the coming of age WYWSIWYGS (Such as Google Web Designer, Macaw and Dreamweaver) - I was looking to ask the question: What kind of a WYSIWYG would i ***actually*** want to use in my workflow?

From my insight - i came with the conclusion that what was mainly inticing about WYSIWYGS was that they provided a way to dynamically change element styling - an "ide" for the mouse.

So what if i can edit my Css with my mouse but without sacrificing my existing workflow?

At least my answer was - an unbiased based js script - or Twyg.

###Features

* Uhh...none?
* Ok..well you can technically make bounding boxes right now for a selected element

###How to Use

* First you need to link twyg.js
* To Select an Element you need to input it into the Twyg console. To open it Press Capital ***"P"*** and ***"Esc"*** to close.
* For element selection its starts like Jquery.
* For Property Selection use "{"
* For ex: #box1{margin
